## What is AWS Free Tier?
Welcome to AWS Free Tier, an introduction to offerings. In this course, we'll dive into the AWS Free Tier offerings, which provides customers the ability to explore and try out AWS services free of charge up to specified limits for applicable services. 

By the end of this course, you'll be able to differentiate between the AWS Free Tier offers, locate Free Tier offerings, and identify Free Tier details and usage limits. 

The AWS Free Tier is offered across 100-plus services and allows you to get hands-on experience with AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and Amazon RDS. 

The AWS Free Tier provides three types of offers. Some services are free to a certain limit every month. Others are free up to 12 months, and some services are short-term free trials, typically 30 or 60 days. 

Knowing the differences between these tiers will equip you with more decision-making power as you begin your Free Tier journey and exploration of AWS services.

## Types of AWS Free Tier offerings
Free tier consists of three distinct types of offerings. Knowing the free tier usage limit as well as the trial period length are important so you don't end up with a surprise bill later on. 

Free trials are short-term trial offers that begin when usage first begins. Once the trial period expires, you simply pay standard pay-as-you-go service rates. Services with a short-term trial are free to use for a specified period of time or up to a one-time limit depending on the service selected. 

12 months free offers are only available to new AWS customers and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. Services with an always free offer allow you to use the product for free up to specified limits as long as you have a valid AWS account. 

Regardless of the free tier offering, you switch to standard pay-as-you-go rates when you exceed the free tier usage limit.

## Who qualifies for AWS Free Tier?
AWS Free Tier is available to all types of customers-students, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and Fortune 500 companies are all welcome to sign up.

## AWS Free Tier Use Cases
Let's look at a few use cases on how AWS Free Tier offers can be combined to meet a variety of cloud computing goals. 

First, there may be a student looking to upskill in cloud computing and has just started learning about AWS. Here are some ways to combine Free Tier offers to meet this goal. They could use EC2 to deploy a Windows Server. They may also look at adopting S3 to host their images. And if they wanted to set up a serverless database, they could consider using RDS Aurora. 

The second use case is a small business owner who wants to develop and host resilient and secure websites and apps. They may consider using AWS Amplify for frontend web and mobile development and to quickly and easily build full stack applications. They may also try out Amazon Lightsail, which automatically configures networking, access, and security environments, taking the guesswork out of launching your server. They could also leverage Amazon Honeycode for building productivity applications quickly with no programming required, helping them to simplify how they work. 

Finally, there may be a senior manager working for a large enterprise. This leader is thinking about using AWS machine learning to improve customer experiences and optimize business processes. They could consider adopting Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy machine learning models with fully managed infrastructure. They could also consider using Amazon Polly to turn text into lifelike speech, allowing their teams to create applications that talk and build entirely new categories of speech-enabled products. They may also consider trying out Amazon Comprehend to derive and understand valuable insights from text within documents, product reviews, social media feeds, and more.

These are just a few examples for combining AWS Free Tier offerings to suit different cloud journeys and goals. What might yours be?
